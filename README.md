# UnEmeraldd Bot Source Code

Welcome! This is both a repository and a library for UnEmeraldd Bot's Source Code, which is open-source, and can be used by anyone!

It's unsure whether to resume this project or not since the bot is no longer in the supposed server - And I can only respect that

The bot uses the `discord.js` library. It's free, open-source, and has a lot of advantages and cool features to get your bot ready up and go with just a few code. Finally, there's a chance in the future that this bot's code will be having also other things like `discord.py`, or `sleepydiscord`, which is a C++ library.

Once again, you're welcome to use the source code, just don't take credit for yourself, please enjoy, and pull requests are welcome
